Automated number testing tool

Requirements: JTAPI, Java 1.8 or Java 1.7.0.79, Cisco Call Manager 11.x

Tested with: Cisco Call Manager 11.5.1.15900-18

Purpose: verify direct inward dialed numbers are working and reach destination PBX.

Pre-testing:
  - Create any type of cisco phone for testing and configure phone with correct dialing privileges and settings.
  - Create a end user in cucm with following privileges
      - Standard CTI Allow Control of Phones supporting Connected Xfer and conf
      - Standard CTI Allow Control of All Devices
      - Standard CTI Enabled
  - Add phone device to "Controlled Devices"
  - The numbers used for testing should be pointing to voicemail/Auto Attendant/Auto Answer Phone, but not required. 
  When the numbers are routed to voicemail/AA, runtime improves significantly.
  - If total numbers ported are 100 or less, prepare a csv file that lists every number getting ported. 
  Otherwise prepare a file with 100 numbers to test. The numbers should be listed as 91+10-digits and whether its internal or 
  external. i.e “912487878187,external” or “913053412733,internal”
  - The Script will take approx. 16 secs per number worst case.
  
Testing steps:
	- prompt user for api admin and user
	- prompt for calling number
	- prompt user for a list of numbers, enter file you prepared "pre-testing"
	- for each number in the list
		- call the number
		- wait until session is established or call timedout or call failure
		- wait 1 sec
		- disconnect and continue to next number
                - if the call failed add to failed calls list
    - print any failed calls

Static settings:
    - Each established call will wait 1 second
    - A call timesout after 15 seconds for internal calls and 10 seconds for external calls
